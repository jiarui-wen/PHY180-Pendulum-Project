# PHY180-Pendulum-Project

I recorded videos of a homemade pendulum released at various lengths and angles. Then I used the motion-tracking software [Tracker](https://github.com/OpenSourcePhysics/tracker) to obtain the pendulum's position at each frame. The position data are then fitted to equations for damped harmonic oscillators, and graphs are produced for visual representation.   

Example graph:
